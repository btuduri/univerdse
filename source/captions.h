	"  Two young, married couples were traveling late at night in a car. They were passing an abandoned World War II TNT factory, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate."
#define _INTRO_02 \
	"  They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big wings folded against its back"
#define _INTRO_03 \
	"  The following night, on November 16, several armed townspeople combed the area around the TNT plant for signs of the mysterious animal. Meanwhile, another local couple was in a car en-route to visit their friends, who lived in a bungalow amongst some storage structures erected during WW-II near the TNT plant."
#define _INTRO_04 \
	"  They were heading back to their car when a figure appeared behind their parked vehicle. The witnesses said that it seemed like it had been lying down, slowly rising up from the ground, large and gray, with glowing red eyes. While they phoned the police, the creature walked onto the porch and peered in at them through the window."
#define _INTRO_05 \
	"  Other sightings of the so-called \"Mothman\" were reported in the following years, but eventually the witnesses were put to silence, and the case was quietly dropped."

#define _INTRO_07 \
	"  Exactly fifty years after the first sighting of the Mothman, mankind was to face the greatest nightmare ever known.\n  As if they were celebrating a jubilee for that particular event, thousands of moth-shaped beings were spotted descending from the sky, thus giving irrefutable proof thet we were not alone in the universe."
#define _INTRO_08 \
	"  But it was not a joyous jubilee, as the Mothmen proved since the beginning to be the deadliest foe man had ever seen.\n  As Angels of Death come from Hell, they began kidnapping humans, killing those who daret to resist.\n  No weapon seemed effective against them and, for a fallen Mothman, at least ten came from above to replace their comrade."
#define _INTRO_09 \
	"  Those who were taken by the Mothmen disappeared between the clouds, their fate unknown.\n  The few human left took shelter in the depth of the underground, hoping to escape the scourge sent from the sky."
#define _INTRO_10 \
	"  Many thought the Mothmen were sent by the Heavens as a punishment. Many others instead were willing to believe that it was just a trial from God, as he had done wit Job in the Bible, and that the survivors would have been rewarded for their Faith, and thus endured their life hidden from light and danger."
#define _INTRO_11 \
	"  But when the Mothmen started breaking into the shelters, killing and kidnapping, showing no mercy nor any other kind of feeling, even the most faithful believers began to writhe in fear, asking God to save them from that nightmare."
#define _INTRO_12 \
	"  But God...                                                                                                                                                                           ..was nowhere to be seen."
